64,Road Transportation Problems.,"Most of the roads are not safe for running a heavyweight vehicle because of their poor maintenance. 
This problem aggravates especially during the rainy season.
A major problem of India roads is high traffic condition. The same road is used by various types of vehicles such 
as high-speed trucks, cars, tractors, two-wheelers, driven carts, cyclists etc. all these things create a high 
traffic jam, pollution, congestion, road accident etc.The Roads in India lack wayside amenities like first aid centers, 
telephone booths, repair shops, restaurants, clean toilets that create serious problems for drivers. 
Moreover, a little attention is given to the road safety issues and also road safety rules violation laws.
The road transportation system of our country requires immediate modernization and latest technology. In the
 road transport sector, the use of old technology and vehicles are still prevalent which ultimately increase the 
number of road accidents. Not only this, due to bad road condition, the transport companies have to bear a huge 
amount per year on wear and tear of the vehicles. This is an important point on which proper attention should be given.
Road direction to the railway department is always indifferent attitude The biggest barrier to the transport in India

contributions even after the bribe and time-consuming. Not only the transport traders but also the large

our media channels like Asianet news, Manorama news, Indiavision etc. Also, here there is a 
common trend ie once roads are repaired, they are broken again manually for underlying the 
cables underground and left without repairing it. Sir/Madam, per day there are lacs of vehicles 
entering the roads from showrooms. How much tax is collected from them? Isn't that
